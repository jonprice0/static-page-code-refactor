# static-page-code-refactor

## Description

In this coding project I began with starter code from the UCF coding bootcamp and refactored it to include semantic elements and improve accessibility.

As the code was refactored in the HTML file, CSS selectors had to be updated to keep the page's styles from breaking. Alt attributes were added to the page's images and icons and a concise, descriptive title was added to the head for browser display. The page's underlying code now follows a more logical, readable structure though the page's appearance hasn't changed. Additionally, I was able to consolidate many of the CSS rules making for a more readable codebase.

Here's a screenshot of the deployed project:
